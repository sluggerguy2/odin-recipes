    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These sausage balls are as good as BisquickÂ® sausage balls, but without the carbs and gluten. They are also keto
        friendly! Eat them fresh out of the oven or refrigerate or freeze for later use.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound shreded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking powder in a large
            bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized
            balls (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes. Remove sausage balls and let cool on the
            pan until oil is reabsorbed, about 5 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
