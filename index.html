        <p>I'm currently practicing flexbox on this page among other things. I know it looks wonky,
            currently I'm trying to have the text in the links to be centered in their little boxes.
            I'll be able to live with myself when that happens. <br><br>
            Adding more recipes later and maybe mini images into the boxes, but then I'd have to make
            the boxes bigger and the list goes on.
